# Unity-Shaders
This repository contains Unity shaders copied / adapted / developed by me (also known as ScooterRF)

Many shaders used here have some code taken from: https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Cg_Programming/Unity,
It's a really great source I reccomend checking out

I highly reccomend taking a look at the 'helpful basics' folder for more insight on the code used
